## Rhythia RP Calculator
Simple calculator that I made in like 30 minutes on C# WPF in Visual Studio

Simply find the Star Rating of a map by going to the map page, and then put in the Speed and the Accuracy of your play, and it will give you the amount that you want!

I MIGHT add on to this the more complex the calculations get, but I'm not sure if I will since I need permission from cunev for the RP formula, and I don't want to ask him everyday for that and be a bother.
